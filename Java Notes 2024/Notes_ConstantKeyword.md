In Java, the `final` keyword and constants are related but serve different purposes.

1. **Final Keyword**:
   - The `final` keyword is used to declare that a variable, method, or class cannot be modified or extended.
   - For variables, a `final` variable must be initialized exactly once either at the time of declaration or in the constructor of the class. Once initialized, its value cannot be changed.
   - For methods, a `final` method cannot be overridden by subclasses.
   - For classes, a `final` class cannot be subclassed.

   Example:
   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       final int constantValue = 10; // Final instance variable

       public void display() {
           final int x = 5; // Final local variable
           // x = 10; // Error: Cannot assign a value to final variable x
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Constants**:
   - Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once assigned. In Java, constants are often declared using the `final` keyword and are typically used for values that are not expected to change during the execution of the program.
   - Additionally, constants in Java are often declared using the `static` keyword to make them class-level constants, allowing them to be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
   - It's common practice to use constants for values that are known at compile time and are not expected to change during runtime.

   Example:
   ```java
   public class Constants {
       public static final int MAX_SIZE = 100;
       public static final String APPLICATION_NAME = "MyApp";
   }

   // Accessing constants
   int maxSize = Constants.MAX_SIZE;
   String appName = Constants.APPLICATION_NAME;
   ```

In summary, while both the `final` keyword and constants contribute to immutability and prevent changes, the `final` keyword is more about immutability at the variable, method, or class level, while constants are typically used for immutable values known at compile time. Constants are often declared using the `final` keyword along with `static` for class-level access.
