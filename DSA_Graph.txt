Neetcode :

- Number of Islands : Flod fill algo 
- Max Area of Island : Flod fill algo 
- Pacific Atlantic Water Flow : do dfs from ocean to inside
- Surrounded Regions : do dfs from outside
- Rotting Oranges : used to approach of As Far from Land as Possible
- Course Schedule : used dfs
- Course Schedule II : used Kahn's algo 
- Redundant Connection : disjoint set, union find algo 
- Network Delay Time : Dijkastra algo, shortest path from a src
- Swim in Rising Water : modified Dijkastra. Thought of brute force on my but but it would have caused tle so saw approach in video 
- Cheapest Flights Within K Stops : saw video, used bellmann ford, nice problem 
- Reconstruct Itinerary : very interesting, saw the video 
- Min Cost to Connect All Points : prims algo, need to learn the impl
- Clone Graph : serious backtracking, wasnt intuitive, saw sol 
- Word Ladder : kind hard, saw sol


Topics :

1. BFS : O(V+E)
2. DFS : O(V+E)

3. Topological Sort :  
    - Recursive : O(V+E)
    - Iterative : Kahn's Algo  O(V+E) : Indegree of vertices and queue, take nodes with 0 indegree first

4. Cycle Detection :
    - DFS : maintain a recursive stack array to detect back edges
    - BFS : Kahn's algo 
    - for undirected graph : maintain a parent variable, if any neighbour is visited and not parent, its a cycle

5. Shortest Path :
    - Dijkastra's Algo : O(E.logV) (Same as ElogE) : Single source shortest path : Non negative weight
    - Bellmanford Algo : O(E.V) : Single source shortest path : Any kind of weight 
    - Floyd Warshall : O(V^3) : Shortest path btw all vertex pairs 

6. Minimum spanning tree : 
    - Prim's Algo : O(E.logV) (similar to Dijkastra's) : Uses priority queue
    - Kruskal's Algo : O(E.logV) : Uses disjoint sets union (Better)

7. Articulation point and bridges :  O(V+E) : smart dfs 
8. Kosaraju algo : for minimum number of strongly connected components : directed graph
9. Disjoin set union 
10. Network flow (usually not asked) : ford fulkerson



Problems :

- Number of Provinces : BFS 
- Reachable Nodes With Restrictions : BFS 
- Course Schedule : Cycle detection
- Course Schedule II : Cycle detection
