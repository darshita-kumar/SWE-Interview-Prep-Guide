- Merge Two Binary Trees : easy 

- Design Circular Queue : easy 

- Climbing Stairs : easy 

- Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences : Good
    did using simple recurssion bcz low constraints but watched video for optimal solution
    video has a completely diff more complex solution using bitmask and hashmap

- Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II : Good 
    I was thinking Sliding Window but priyasha thought of a simple stack solution 




22 Aug 2023:

- Unique Email Addresses : easy 

- Permutations : revise 
    took time to hit, but simple backtracking. Should revise

- Permutations II : Revise 
    Did using hashSet and pre question 
    Not the best way to do, doing unnecessary iterations, saw video for better sol 
    
- Longest Consecutive Sequence : Revise 
    Priyasha suggested, couldnt think on my own 


- Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum : Good, Able to in one go


23 Aug 2023:

- Product of Array Except Self :
    did using 2 arrays
    can store values of those two arrays in solution array itself 




30 Aug 2023:

- Merge Intervals : Revise 
    Easy concept but java language concepts like custom comparator, converting list of array to 2d array 


- Frog Jump : Revise
    Very very good dp problem 
    Used top down dp, time limit exceeded (worked after minor optimization)
    saw youtube solution : could do  using bottom up db 




31 Aug 2023:

- Word Search : backtracking, easy 

- Valid Perfect Square : seemed easy, ignored 
- Remove Nth Node From End of List : ignored, seemed easy

- Burst Balloons : 
    A problem I always wanted to revise, skipped, saw solution, didnt want to code 


1 Sep 2023:
- Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden
    skipped for later, have seen hints and hence know the approach but feeling lazy to code 

- Minimum Size Subarray Sum
    skipped, easy

- Combination Sum
    did in first go 



3 Sep 2023:

- Extra Characters in a String : Revise
    Piyu gave approach, did using dp and recursion, good question 


- Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges
    Very easy dp but memory limit exceeded, this makes it hard 





- Path With Minimum Effort
- Number of Good Paths
- Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes
