- Invert Binary Tree	
- Maximum Depth of Binary Tree	
- Diameter of Binary Tree	
- Balanced Binary Tree	
- Same Tree	
- Subtree of Another Tree	
- Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST	
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
- Binary Tree Right Side View (same as level order)
- Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree
- Validate Binary Search Tree : Do in order traversal 
- Kth Smallest Element in a BST 
- Construct binary tree from preorder and inorder traversal (SOme tricky part in it, got most of it in first time, need to revise)
- Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum : (Not hard, use diameter logic, there weight of every node is 1 here weight is equal to value. Make sure to deal with negative weights)
- Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree : Saw hint, then able to do


- Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree (Hard to think on your own, very small solution, need to revise)
- Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
- Maximum Width of Binary Tree (TODO)
- Vertical Width of a Binary Tree
