Walmart Experience : 

WFS :
- Enabling sellers across mexico canada and chile to sell their products on Walmart website. 
- Walmart Supply Chain as a service 
- 

China NP :

Calgary :
- Saved cost by improving Cartonization algorithm used by Walmart International by reducing the number of Boxes that are needed to pack the items. In Pilot FC, 2.6M units are expected to be shipped in 2023 with the GMV of $33M. Received team award for the same. 

Fixit : 
- Infra setup, frontend and backend alone with collaboration from multiple outside teams such as: fixit-US backend, fixit-mobile, fixit-web, RMT, LMT, tridents, centurions. Documented each step which was widely used by everyone during the whole project. 
- Data modelling, GraphQL
- FIXit is a new product that will report, track and act on inbound exceptions. This is International’s first cloud based SaaS component integrated with GLS Products, which sits in its own cloud infrastructure. Import items, such as grocery, electronics, etc., require government certification before they are shipped from a DC/ FC. This process may take ~15-30 days to complete. FIXit creates labels and moves the pallets to the identified reserve slot, without going through the hassle of problem freight area. Pallets are kept on hold until certification is received and moved off hold on a simple click, making it readily available for sale. Speed and ease of usage with mobile and web interfaces using cloud framework. The key impacts of this Product are - Reduced man power (37% up to 75% reduction?), resolve space constraints, improves inventory availability, provides a unified product to report, track and act on exceptions, Faster ticket creation and resolution(from 7 mins to 3.5 mins). The product is stabilised in the DC right now with zero defects. 


Operational excellence : 
- Spring boot vulnerabilities

Engineering Excellence :
- Received bravo award for taking initiative and implementing CI/CD in team repos. 
- Received innovation badge for creating a ChatBot using Generative AI to help Walmart consumers as a hackathon project.

extra :
- organising fun events
- newsletter
- mentoring interns
- Hackathon : team leader twice
- Extensice documentation helped in onboarding vendors and other developers when moving to a different team or project 
- Helping HR team to create test papers for freshers hiring


Challenges : 
- One team member got hospitalised on the day of hackathon. Even after many Challenges we did not compromise on our idea and delivered what we had planned on time.  
- Team lead not helping, step up in gathering requirements documentation and design, reduce lot of re work later and zero prod defects
