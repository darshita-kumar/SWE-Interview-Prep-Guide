### [N Queen](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/description/) ⭐️⭐️⭐️
- Can do 

### [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/) 
> Print all subsets
- Can do

### [Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/) ⭐️
> Print all combinations where sum equal to target. Array will not contain duplicates, can only take 1 element any number of times

- Did in first attempt. Although not very straight forward

### [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/description/) ⭐️
> Print all permutations 

- Did in first attempt. Although not very straight forward
- Could not do after 6 months, Had to see solution

### [Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/description/) ⭐️⭐️
> Print all subsets (Array may contain duplicates, dont print duplicate subsets)

- Sort the array. They we can use hashmap to check for duplicates before adding temp in sol.
- Better (saw sol) : Sort the array, when on the "dont take ith" step, move the pointer to right and jump over all duplicates

### [Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/description/) ⭐️⭐️
> Print all combinations where sum equal to target. Array may contain duplicates, can only take 1 element once, sol must not contains duplicates

- Amalgum of combination sums and Subsets II

### [Unique Paths III](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-iii/description/) ⭐️

- Good ques, can do in 1 go


### [Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/description/) ⭐️
