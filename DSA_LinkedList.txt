- Add Two Numbers : Good question, corner cases 

- Remove Nth Node From End of List : use slow and fast 

- Delete Node in a Linked List

- Odd Even Linked List

- Reverse Linked List	(Easy but need to practise to solve under 5-10 mins)
- Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy but need to practise to solve under 5-10 mins)

- Reorder List (mix of reverse and merge, need to solve quickly)
- Copy List With Random Pointer (need to solve quickly)

- Linked List Cycle existence

- Find the Duplicate Number (hard, cant think organically)

- Merge k Sorted Lists (Use heap of size k)

- Reverse Nodes in k-Group (My sol was really messy, look a better sol)

- LRU Cache : very very good, kinda lengthy though
