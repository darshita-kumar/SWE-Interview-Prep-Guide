Can you provide an example of a project or task that required you to learn something new quickly? How did you approach the learning process? 

Tell me about a time when you identified a major problem in your workplace. How did you go about solving it?

Can you give an example of a time when you disagreed with a team member? How did you handle the situation and what was the outcome?

Tell me about a time when you made a mistake at work. How did you handle it and what did you learn from the experience?

Imagine you work in a place with negative culture, what would you do about it and how would you improve it
