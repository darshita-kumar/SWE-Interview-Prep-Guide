- Tell me about yourself 
- What are some technical challenges you have faced 
- Convert Roman Number to Integer 

- How many objects will be created in System.out.println(i + " " + ch);
- How many objects will be created in String s = "abc"; String s1 = s + "pqr"; s = "xyz"; 
- Diff ways to initialise string. << String s3 = "def"; String s4 = new String("def") >> 
- What is the Difference between them, what is the need for new String("def")

- What collections you have worked upon
- You have to create a TreeSet of custom class. implement it. what interfaces would you implement and what methods would you override 
- what is hashcode method
- how will treeset handle duplicate elements 

- Write interface 
- How can we have an interface that inherits another interface. what will the use case of this?
- how can i have a method in interface that is optional to imlement 

- Tell me about exceptions in java
- what is parent of Exception class? who else is child of throwable except Exception
- how will you handle/prevent outofmemory exception? 

- 5 kafka consumers, msg should be processed by only 1 consumer  
- 5 kafka consumers are subscribed to same topic. Message will have an identifier for market, each consumer belongs to a market. msg should onlh go to its markets consumer. how will you do it? 


- Have you create a module from scratch

- How to refer variables from application properties files
- Difference between env variables, program arguments, vm options
- how to refer system variables
- how spring knows which env variable to call: stg, prod, dev? do we tell it or it does automatically

- How many ways to do dependency injection, constructor injection?
- How spring knows which class to inject, if you are autowiring an interface 

- What databases you use : I interrupted the call saying its gone too long.
