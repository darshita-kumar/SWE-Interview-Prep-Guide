Heap : 

 - K Largest Elements / Kth Largest Element (easy, need to do quicker)
 - Last Stone Weight 


 - K most frequent elements  (REVISE)

        Hashmap to store the frequencies
        then make a k size priority queue of pairs having key value pairs where key is element and value is freq. make a custom comparator

 - Find Median from Data Stream : Make sure to rebalance after every addition



 - Sliding Window Maximum HARD (TODO)

 - Sliding Window Median HARD (TODO)

 - Merge k Sorted Lists HARD (TODO)

 - Implement Heap (TODO)


- Task Scheduler : Hard, saw sol
- Design Twitter : Wasnt hard, similar to merge k sorted lists, still saw sol
